# Reading And Resource Lists

The reading and resource lists in this repository are collections of curated open access resources on various topics. Each list covers one topic. I focus on open access resources for these lists so anyone can learn about the topics covered without having to traverse paywalls. Curation is an important aspect of these lists as only 20 out of 41 resources that I've reviewed have been accurate, met inclusiveness expectations, and contained current information. 

If you have suggestions for resource list topics, resources to add, or have any other comments about this repository or anything in it, please email me at b@straithe.com, submit a pull request, or raise a GitHub issue to let me know.
