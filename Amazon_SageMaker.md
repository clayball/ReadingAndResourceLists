# Amazon SageMaker Reading and Resource List

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides developers and data scientists with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. In this reading and resource list I provide a collection of curated open access resources on Amazon SageMaker for those wishing to learn more about it. I focused on open access resources for this list so anyone can learn about Amazon SageMaker without having to traverse paywalls. Curation of this list involved assessing 11 resources, 5 of which were accepted to be part of this list, and 6 of which were rejected. The 5 resources that were accepted were accurate, met inclusiveness expectations, did not require unrelated prior knowledge, and contained current information. If you think I missed a resource, or have any comments about this list or anything on it, please email me at b@straithe.com, submit a pull request, or raise a GitHub issue to let me know.
