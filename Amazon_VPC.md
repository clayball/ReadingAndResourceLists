# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Reading and Resource List

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the networking layer for Amazon EC2. Amazon VPC enables you to launch Amazon Web Services resources into a virtual network that you've defined. In this reading and resource list I provide a collection of curated open access resources on Amazon VPC for those wishing to learn more about it. I focused on open access resources for this list so anyone can learn about Amazon VPC without having to traverse paywalls. Curation of this list involved assessing 10 resources, 5 of which were accepted to be part of this list, and 5 of which were rejected. The 5 resources that were accepted were accurate, met inclusiveness expectations, did not require unrelated prior knowledge, and contained current information. If you think I missed a resource, or have any comments about this list or anything on it, please email me at b@straithe.com, submit a pull request, or raise a GitHub issue to let me know.
